### Description

This is a repo for illustrating the solar system. There're many options you can choose to play. All data of planets, solar, satellites and comets, are from wiki, which is very real.

The gravity constant G = 6.67430 \* 10 ^ -6, cuz all space distance unit is x10^3 km, and mass unit is 10^24 kg.

Using these data, I've calculated the gravity acceleration is really 9.8... :)

I've spend for about 1 month for this application. It's based on WEBGL.

## Visit, just play it with enjoyment.
